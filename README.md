# Country Autocomplete

This is a simple, reusable country dropdown component for your web applications. It uses Google's Places and Geocoding API to fetch the list of countries. 

The advantage of using Google API is that we can search for countries in any language. For example, if you search for "India" in Hindi, you will get the same result as if you searched for "India" in English.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add country-autocomplete
```

## Prerequisites

This component requires a Google API key to function correctly. You need to provide your own API key in order to use this component. You can get your API key from [here](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key).

Once you have the key, add it to your environment variables:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

Replace `<your-api-key>` with your actual API key.

## Usage

```js
import React from 'react';
import CountryAutocomplete from 'country-autocomplete';

const App = () => {
  const [country, setCountry] = React.useState('');

  return (
    <div>
      <CountryAutocomplete
        value={country}
        onSelect={setCountry}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```
